# Predemy

## Overview
Predemy is a platform for online education. This project follows an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) approach with microservices architecture.

## Security Architecture
We implement a hybrid security approach for optimal performance and security:

- **Standard Requests**: JWT stateless validation
  - Signature verification
  - Expiration check
  - Role-based access control

- **Critical Operations** (Planned): Enhanced security with state validation
  - JWT validation plus database check
  - Redis-based token blacklist/verification
  - Will be used for sensitive operations:
    - Password changes
    - Payment processing
    - Account deletion
    - Profile updates

## Services Status

| Service | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| User Service | âœ… MVP Complete | Handles user management, roles, and profiles |
| Course Service | âœ… MVP Complete | Manages courses, enrollments and instructor content |
| Register Service | âœ… Complete | Eureka Server for service discovery |
| Proxy Service | âœ… Complete | API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway |
| Auth Service | ðŸš§ In Development | Basic JWT authentication, more features planned |
| Notification Service | ðŸ“… Planned | Email notifications for registered users |

## Auth Service Roadmap
- [x] Basic JWT authentication
- [x] Role-based access control
- [x] Service-to-service communication
- [ ] Refresh token implementation
- [ ] Redis integration for token management
- [ ] Enhanced security for sensitive operations
- [ ] Token blacklisting
- [ ] Session management
- [ ] Rate limiting
